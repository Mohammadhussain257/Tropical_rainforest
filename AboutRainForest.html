						<h2>What is Tropical Rainforest</h2>
					<p>
					Tropical rainforests are rainforests that occur in areas of tropical rainforest climate in which there is no dry season – all months have an average precipitation of at least 60 mm – and may also be referred to as lowland equatorial evergreen rainforest. True rainforests are typically found between 10 degrees north and south of the equator (see map); they are a sub-set of the tropical forest biome that occurs roughly within the 28 degree latitudes (in the equatorial zone between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn). Within the World Wildlife Fund's biome classification, tropical rainforests are a type of tropical moist broadleaf forest (or tropical wet forest) that also includes the more extensive seasonal tropical forests
					</p>
					<p>A tropical rainforest, as the name suggests, is a rainforest that grows in a tropical region. Tropical regions are found near the Equator – an imaginary line that runs around the middle of the planet.
					Running parallel above and below the Equator are two more imaginary lines: the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn respectively. The world’s tropical regions are located within these lines.

					<h2>Why it is Important</h2>
				<p>
				Tropical forests regulate global and regional climate-systems by acting as heat and water pumps. They release moisture into the atmosphere which returns to the ground as rain. When the forest is cleared, the water cycle is disrupted, temperatures increase, droughts become common, and eventually deserts may form. For example, the drought in the Sahelian belt (south of the Saharah Desert), has been attributed to deforestation in West Africa. Estimates suggest that tropical deforestation currently contributes at least 19% of greenhouse gas emissions. Tropical forests have been described as "the lungs of the Earth". However in mature primary forest, storage and release of carbon is in balance. Carbon-dioxide consumed during photosynthesis is equalled by that released when organic matter decays. A standing forest acts as a store or sink of carbon. On the other hand, when forests are burned or logged and the debris left to decay, carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere.

				<h2>How Tropical Rainforest is important for plants and animals</h2>
				<p>
				Earth's rainforests are rich in plant and animal life. In fact, the Amazon rainforest alone contains around 10 percent of all known species on earth. Plants and animals living in the rainforest must deal with a host of challenges, including competition for food, near-constant rainfall and the threat of predators. Luckily, rainforest inhabitants have developed adaptations to cope with these challenges. The specific adaptations of rainforest plants and animals depend on the species, with four species in particular standing out for their ability to thrive in such a volatile location.
				</p>
				<p>
				Rainforest plants and animals have developed adaptations that help them to thrive. For example, some plants in soil that is low in nutrients have adapted to eat meat, while different animals have developed lethal poisons to ward off predators.
