			<p>Adopting a panda is a fun and easy way to have a direct impact on the daily life and care of our beloved pandas. While it is a symbolic adoption, you can still choose your panda. You may have a specific panda in mind to adopt, or you can select from the many adults and cubs available for adoption. </p>

			<div class="grid-box"><img src="Images/adopt-animal/animal-animal-photography-close-up-918595.jpg" alt="image-of-wolf "/>
				<p>wolves are usually not aggressive. However, they will fight other animals and even other wolves in order to protect their pack. This is where the stories often come in of wolves being violent killers. Right now the biggest threat is to them and not to other animals or humans. The reduction of their habitat has created a great deal of hardship for the wolves.</p>

			<div class="grid-box"><img src="Images/adopt-animal/animal-animal-world-avian-45853.jpg" alt="two-gray-crane-bird" />
				<p>The grey crowned crane is closely related to the black crowned crane, and the two species have sometimes been treated as the same species. The two are separable on the basis of genetic evidence, calls, plumage and bare parts, and all authorities treat them as different species today.</p>

				<p>
				Gorillas inhabit the vast tropical and subtropical forests of Central Africa. Gorillas are herbivorous, feeding on fruit, shoots, bulbs, leaves and occasionally tree bark. They live in family groups that are led by one dominant male, called the silverback because of the silver hair that runs down his back.

			<div class="grid-box"><img src="Images/adopt-animal/animal-bald-bald-eagle-632452.jpg" alt="black-and-white-color-eagle" />
				<p>The bald eagle will also prey upon other birds and small mammals, such as rabbits. A conservation success story, after being protected under the Endangered Species Act, bald eagle populations in the lower 48 states have been down listed to “threatened.” These majestic birds are still at risk due to habitat loss, toxins, and pollution.</p>

			<div class="grid-box"><img src="Images/adopt-animal/animal-beak-bird-9291.jpg" alt="Scarlet-Parrot" />
				<p>Scarlet Macaws are found in tropical forests from eastern Mexico to the Peruvian Amazon and Brazil. These brilliantly colored birds survive on a diet of fruits and seeds. Highly intelligent, macaws mate for life and may live up to 70 years. Currently, the species is at risk due to habitat loss and capture for illegal bird trade.</p>

			<div class="grid-box"><img src="Images/adopt-animal/animal-bright-bunny-372166.jpg" alt="bunny-the-rabbit" />
				<p>The pygmy rabbit’s dependence on big sagebrush makes it vulnerable to habitat loss. Females build birthing burrows apart from the rest of the burrow systems. These burrows have one entrance leading into a nesting area and are often located at the base of shrubs. Common predators include weasels, coyotes, badgers, bobcats, raptors, owls, crows, and foxes.</p>

				<p>Like human children, bear cubs are extremely playful; and just like human mothers, if things get too rough, mother bears will make them stop to protect them from hurting themselves.</p>

			<div class="grid-box"><img src="Images/adopt-animal/animals-avian-beak-917596.jpg" alt="one-pair-duck" />
				<p>Ducks are often the most familiar types of birds to many beginning birders and non-birders, but even experienced birders or duck hunters may not know just how unique these birds can be. These duck facts are sure to surprise you!</p>

				Adopt a KoalaKoala
				Found throughout the eastern and coastal regions of Australia, koalas survive on a diet of eucalyptus leaves. With strong limbs, sharp claws and opposable thumbs, koalas are well adapted to climbing. These marsupials are nocturnal, and spend most of the day sleeping in the crooks of trees. During the night, koalas climb high into the trees to eat several pounds of eucalyptus leaves. </p>

				Proboscis Monkey
				Preferring coastal areas and mangrove forests, proboscis monkeys are found only on the island of Borneo. They eat fruits, leaves, seeds, shoots and occasionally invertebrates. Aided by webbing between their digits, proboscis monkeys are excellent swimmers and will leap from trees into the water, sometimes swimming deep under the surface.</p>
