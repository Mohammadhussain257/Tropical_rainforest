				<h3>Want to help the Campaign</h3>
					<p>
					Forests are crucial for the health and well-being of people, wildlife, and our planet. They’re home to roughly two-thirds of all land-dwelling plant and animal species, critical lifelines for communities big and small, and one of the last lines of defense against catastrophic climate change.
					</p>
					<p>
					A new campaign is calling on consumers to directly support forest conservation with their wallets.

					“Stand For Trees” is an initiative launched by Code REDD, a marketing platform for a group of organizations running REDD+ forest conservation projects. Code REDD partners distinguish themselves by adhering to higher standards than conventional REDD+ projects, which aim to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.

					The campaign represents a departure from previous REDD+ efforts which focused primarily on selling REDD+ credits to large entities like companies aiming to offset their emissions for corporate social responsibility (CSR) or sustainability programs. “Stand For Trees” instead targets end consumers by emphasizing the non-carbon benefits of protecting forests, like supporting forest-dependent communities and safeguarding habitat for wildlife.

				<h3>How to arragne a trip to the Amazon Rainforest</h3>
				<p>
				The Amazon is a 4,400-mile river with thousands of tributaries. It is a 2,600,000-square mile basin, draining rivers and streams in eight countries (Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana and Suriname), as well as French Guiana. Its broadleaved forest is the largest on the planet and its biome – the forest combined with the savannah, floodplains and rivers – is a region of immense diversity, sheltering more than 30,000 plant species, 1,800 fish, 1,300 bird species, 311 mammals and 165 types of amphibian.

				<h3>When to travel</h3>
				<p>
				
				Given such a vast area, it is impossible to talk of a single weather system or neatly defined seasons. In the broadest terms, the rainy season in the Amazon is November or December to June (though Ecuador has a dry season between January and March). The river rises and floods the low-lying forests (called várzeas in Brazil) that lie along the banks, after which many channels become passable.

				The dry – or drier – season, runs from July to December. As the temperature rises the mosquito numbers go down, and the receding rains expose trails and beaches. This can be good for hiking and fishing and for sightings of caiman as they compete for dwindling food sources.

			<div class="how_to_travel">
				<h3>How to travel</h3>
				<p>
				There are hundreds of ways into the Amazon. Independent travel is possible and may suit those with weeks to spare, but it comes with complications. You can fly into Belém and book onto a local boat and then arrange flights or epic bus journeys on from Manaus, or head directly for Iquitos or Leticia with only flights. You can also email the lodges in major parks such as Tambopata, Mamirauá, Manú or Yasuni reserves – which range from ultra-luxury hotels to basic shacks to more science-oriented lodges such as the Uacari Lodge near Tefe and the brand new Inkaterra Guides Field Station in Tambopata – and the smarter boat operators (Delfin, Amazon Clipper, Manatee Amazon Explorer) directly and they will advise on logistics.

				But you also need local operators for transfers and – because the best trips tend to be in remote areas – food, drink, water, boats and local guides (who may speak only Spanish or even an indigenous language, meaning a second guide).
					
				Sudden, torrential showers are daily occurrences across the Amazon, and flights are often delayed, and connections easily missed. In short, if you have limited time and want to go deep into the jungle or explore the backwaters, you’re probably best organising your trip beforehand. Booking with a UK operator gives you a chance to browse what’s on offer, as well as the security of insurance and backup.

				The first question to ask is: land or water? Almost all visitors take to the river at some point but there’s a huge difference between a four-day cruise and a three-hour transfer by motorised dugout. The second is: luxury or budget? The former will cut you off from local culture, but the latter may mean basic loos, windowless chalets and warm beer with dinner. A good ecolodge is often the best compromise and specialist tour operators will have surveyed the options and visited many of them.
